# Abstract
Mobility is one of the most important issues in the development and design of intelligent mobile robots to achieve a specific goal. To navigate locally and self-plan a path to reach a desired destination, neural networks are used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data because they provide more convenient solutions than the traditional methods used previously. However, current neural network navigation methods are limited to one type of bot platform and range sensor, and usually cannot be extended to other types of bots with different range sensors without the need to change the network structures. In this paper we propose a general method for interpreting data from different types of 2D range sensors, where the sensors will be used to predict the distances between the robot and the wall in front of it and the neural network algorithm to perform the navigation task. Our approach can lead to a global mobility algorithm that can be applied to different
